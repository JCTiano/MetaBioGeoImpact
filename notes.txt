SCRIPT 1
- Where SD's are missing we either
	- Calculate the missing value based on known values as prescribed (of same variable and study type).
	- Give 0 value if n = 1

SCRIPT 2
- I remove certain rows where no SD / Mean value is even found --> mainly "Excess Pb" and "Excess Th"
- Then I remove rows where NaN is produced 
	- response 1 = 0 and response 2 = 0, mostly "Gravel" from study 2, 20, 23, 69, 154.
	- Change of sign, e.g. for some fluxes ==> I suggest we don't use them.
- Change Infinities to NA
	- x/0 or 0/x, again studies 5, 20, 69.
	- Again excess Pb and Th, sand, gravel.
