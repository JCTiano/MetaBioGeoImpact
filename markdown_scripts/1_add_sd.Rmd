# Intro

We add missing standard deviations 

```{r read data}

# Load dataset
df <- read.csv("../dataset/trawling_meta-analysis_grouped6_3_2023.csv")
colnames(df) <- make.names(colnames(df), unique=TRUE)

# Make standard deviations positive
df[,c(6, 45, 50, 55)] <- abs(df[,c(6, 45, 50, 55)]) # make all SD positive.

# new column for use in analysis or not.
df$useadv <- NA
df$sdadded <- NA
df$toremoveAC <- NA
df$toremoveAI <- NA
df$toremoveBI <- NA
df$toremoveBC <- NA

# Make new columns for effect size calculations
df$response1=NA
df$SD1=NA
df$n1=NA

df$response2=NA
df$SD2=NA
df$n2=NA

```

## Fill in missing sd

# I don't think i can use all treatments together to calculate missing sd.
