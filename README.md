Tiano, J., De Borger, E., Paradis, S., Bradshaw, C., Morys, C., Pusceddu, A., Ennas, C., Soetaert, K., Puig, P., Masqu√©, P., & Sciberras, M. (2024). Global meta-analysis of demersal fishing impacts on organic carbon and associated biogeochemistry. Fish and Fisheries, doi:10.1111/FAF.12855.

# Folder structures

*/dataset* contains the dataset as a flatfile and associated metadata

*/database_grouping* contains python scripts to group observations together (calculate weighed averages if needed) into individual observations (rows) for the meta-analysis

*/markdown_scripts* contains r-markdown scripts in which calculations are perfomed/output is generated step-by-step.

*/r_objects* contains .rda files etc needed to support running the code.

*/source_code* contains .R files containing functions used in the markdown scripts.
